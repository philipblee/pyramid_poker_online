- Sorting strategy 2
- Arrangement Model includes "unused cards in staging"
- Card Model card: includes 2 card string
- Card Model alphaCard: includes alpha string which is "Suit+Rank" or "W"+"number
    Suit is "SHDC", "A23456789TJQK"
- 3 wild and 4 wild solve by adding one wild at a time and calling find-best-setup-one-wild

- current data 2,000 round 12,000 hands - not enough
- next data set 12,000 rounds 72,000 hands
- better data will create better setups, better setups will improve data
- run again, to get better setups. etc.

- time to fix hand model to include positionExpectedValue or EV
- make the findbestsetup series all use arrangement for calling and returning
- get rid of tiebreaker for empirical and tiered

- ok got three methods sort of working - empirical, tiered, points
- empirical based on 12,000 rounds/72,000 hands
- tiered based on 3 tuple - estimated prob that is tiered by hand type, spread uniformly
- points is just number of points for hand, flawed as hands of different ranks get same points
- got it mostly working, testing with 90 hands
- 10 cases each for nowild, onewild and two wild; each solved with empirical, tiered and points
- only problem is no-wild points has a problem, not whole number final point total

- created branch "explore-complete-hands-explosion"
- did a lot of work, ended up with about 5097 hands, most were high card hands 5-cards
- performance horrible, from 200ms to 5200ms.  not worth it
- restored to main for next project.

2025=07-27
- I want to fix points
- Maybe look for ways to refactor code for easier maintenance
- evaluateHand and scoringUtilities needs improving
